# Monty Interpreter

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte code (just like in Python). It uses a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. 

This project creates an interpreter for Monty ByteCode files, utilizing Stacks (LIFO) and Queues (FIFO). 

# Start

<u>Monty</u>:

Simply Compile: `$ gcc *.c -o monty`

Then Run: `$ ./monty filename.m`

A sample bytecode file is located at `/bytecodes/test.txt`.
